                        <p>Today, news plays a vital role in the globe. A specific family table requires the presence of news. They are the world's mirrors. The press is known as the "fourth pillar" of democracy. News is the most powerful of the powerful. They are the keepers of the truth and of human rights. They act as the public's spokesperson. They serve as a conduit between the people and the government.</p>
                        <p>The news provides us with the most up-to-date information. The primary job of the news is to deliver the most recent information to the North, South, East, West, and all other corners of the world. A news story can cover a wide range of themes and reach a wide range of readers, including statesmen, students, politicians, public figures, travelers, scientists, intellectuals, and businesspeople. It also instructs unemployed individuals on where to apply for jobs. Chronic bachelors and sisters might find life partners through matrimonial adverts.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is News?</h2>
                        <p>News is one of the most trustworthy content not only on YouTube but in the whole world. Some viewers also consider it important as it contains information about current events letting us know what happened, what is happening, and what will be happening. It is an important type of content where it provides information about current events. News reports also include topics about politics, new laws, and proclamations, new events, announcements, trending content, etc. </p>
                        <p>The news written on a website or the news announced should also be accurate since the only purpose of it is to tell what's happening around your surroundings and not your opinion. News is frequently used for entertainment reasons as well; to give a diversion of knowledge about areas people cannot access or have little control over.</p>
                        <p>News can also help individuals feel more connected. Education allows you to connect with the rest of the world and become a part of something bigger. Strangers are brought together by their understanding of what is going on and then work together to make a difference and begin to solve the situation. Staying informed allows you to become a part of the solution.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Who is the Audience?</h2>
                        <p>For the news content, the public is the target audience (Any person of any age, either senior, adults, or children). In simple words, everyone can be an audience for news. Here’s why. Everyone needs to be informed. Especially now, we’re currently facing a global pandemic, we have to be aware of what’s happening around us. Being educated helps you to connect with the rest of the world and become a part of something larger. </p>
                        <a href=""><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/public.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Our target audience, the public.</span>
                        <p>Horrible occurrences are no longer private and are more difficult to ignore when they are splattered on the front pages of newspapers. When we read about someone else's pain, it becomes personal to us. For example, horrifying reports of terrorist acts throughout the world are frequently followed by an outpouring of solidarity. Strangers are brought together by their understanding of what is going on and then work together to make a difference and begin to solve the situation. Staying informed allows you to become a part of the solution. </p>
